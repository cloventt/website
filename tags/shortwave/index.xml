      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m pretty notorious for jumping around between hobbies. I&amp;rsquo;ll normally stick to one for a few months and then drop it, only to circle back around to it a few years later. One hobby I&amp;rsquo;ve always been fascinated with but never actually got stuck into is amateur radio. At the moment I&amp;rsquo;m gearing up towards getting my General Amateur Operatorâ€™s Certificate of Competency so I can get on the air (I&amp;rsquo;ve had some pretty amazing help from the Christchurch branch of the NZART and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to achieve that goal in the next few weeks).</description>
